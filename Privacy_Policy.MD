# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how our Discord bot collects, uses, and manages your information. By using our bot, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

1. Information Collection and Storage

Our Discord bot may collect and store the following information:
a) User ID: Stored when you interact with the economy or level system. If you do not use the economy system, no economy-related data will be stored for you.
b) Message Content: Stored only if a message contains words forbidden by the automoderation system. Regular messages that do not trigger forbidden words are not stored.
c) Customization Data: Including uploaded images/GIFs for level cards and custom footer text.
d) XP and Level Data: The bot tracks XP and level for all users who chat on the server, regardless of their interaction with other bot features.

2. Purpose of Data Collection

a) Economy and Level System: User IDs are stored to keep track of your points, current level and XP and cooldowns related to the economy system.
b) Automoderation: Message content is stored for moderation purposes when triggered by forbidden words.
c) Customization: User-provided images, GIFs, and text are stored to personalize level cards and footers.

3. Data Retention and Deletion

a) Active Members: If you remain in the server, your data (including User ID, automoderation data, and customization data) is retained indefinitely or until you leave the server.
b) Former Members: If you leave the server or are removed from the server, all your data (including User ID, automoderation data, and customization data) will be automatically deleted after 30 days.

4. Data Usage and Sharing

The data collected is used solely for the functioning of the bot within this Discord server. We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to third parties.

5. Changes to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy in the server. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
